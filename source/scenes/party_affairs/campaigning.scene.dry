= Campaigning

Whether or not we are in an electoral campaign, the party is always trying to broaden its voter base. Who should we focus our campaign efforts on?

- @workers: The urban working class, our traditional support base.
- @new_middle: The "new middle class" of government employees and white-collar workers.
- @old_middle: The "old middle class" of small independent businessmen and artisans.
- @rural: Rural workers and small farmers, who have felt neglected by us in the past.
- @unemployed: The unemployed.

We have increased our campaigning among the workers. [? if unemployed >= 15: The high levels of unemployment make our campaign more difficult. ?][? if wtb_adopted = 1 : Adopting the WTB plan gives us a new rallying point around which to attract workers. ?]

[? if welfare < 0: The welfare cuts and resultant poverty make our campaign more difficult, since we are associated with the government that enacted these cuts, and it may even backfire. ?][? if wtb_adppted = 1 : Adopting the WTB plan gives us a new rallying point around which to attract support from the unemployed. ?]
