= Addressing the Economic Crisis

Our party is wracked as to how to deal with the economic crisis. From the centrist faction, Hilferding argues that the economic crisis must be allowed to play out, because it is simply a part of the cyclic nature of capitalism.

From labor, the economist Wladimir Woytinsky argues that we must pursue a massive public works program to reduce unemployment and stimulate demand, perhaps including deficit spending. His opponents, like Hilferding, argue that this plan will cause a return to hyper-inflation, and that it would not even help the economy. In addition, according to Hilferding, Woytinsky's strategy is opposed to Marxist principles.

The so-called WTB plan, after its chief supporters Woytinsky, Tarnow, and Baade, is receiving more attention within the party.

- @support_centrist: Support the Centrist view - let the depression play itself out.
- @support_labor: Support the Labor view - call for increased public works and fiscal stimulus.
- @defer: Defer making a decision until we have more information.

Woytinsky and the trade unions vehemently criticize the centrists for their policy. The workers are starving; are we going to callously abandon them and side with bourgeois austerity? On the other hand, the centrists criticize Woytinsky for promising the workers false hope; their position is that nothing can be done to alleviate the depression. They also speak of the fear of another round of hyperinflation that may result from deficit spending.

Our policy course is currently that nothing can be done to alleviate the depression.

# TODO: how do we actually adopt the WTB plan?

on-arrival: center_dissent += 10; labor_strength += 5; wtb_support += 1;
go-to: plan_adopted if wtb_support >= 3; plan_support if wtb_supprt < 3

@plan_support

Our support of the WTB plan alienates the orthodox Marxists of the Centrist faction, and faces both opposition and support from a variety of sources across the spectrum.

We have not yet convinced the party to formally adopt the plan. More work needs to be done.

@plan_adopted
on-arrival: wtb_adopted = 1; labor_dissent -= 15; reformist_dissent -= 10; labor_strength += 10; center_strength -= 10; center_dissent += 20; economic_plan = 1

With our hard work, we have finally convinced the majority of the party to adopt the WTB plan! [? if spd_in_government == 1 : We can begin implementing the plan as soon as possible, as long as we have the Economic or Finance ministries. ?][? if spd_in_government = 0 : We should emphasize the plan in our electoral propaganda. ?]


@defer

We hold off on making a decision on economic policy, awaiting more information. Woytinsky and his supporters argue that inaction is a form of action of its own.
